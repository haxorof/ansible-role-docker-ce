- name: Compatibility check - Fail if both MountFlags=slave and live-restore are set
  fail:
    msg: >
      Setting both `MountFlags=slave` (docker_enable_mount_flag_fix: true)
      and `live-restore=true` (docker_daemon_config['live-restore']: true)
      triggers a bug (https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/35873). For now,
      don't use both.
  when:
    - docker_enable_mount_flag_fix | bool
    - docker_daemon_config['live-restore'] is defined
    - docker_daemon_config['live-restore']
