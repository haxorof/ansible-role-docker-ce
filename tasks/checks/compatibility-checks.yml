- name: Compatibility check - Fail if both MountFlags=slave and live-restore are set
  when:
    - docker_enable_mount_flag_fix | bool
    - docker_daemon_config['live-restore'] is defined
    - docker_daemon_config['live-restore']
  ansible.builtin.fail:
    msg: >
      Setting both `MountFlags=slave` (docker_enable_mount_flag_fix: true)
      and `live-restore=true` (docker_daemon_config['live-restore']: true)
      triggers a bug (https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/35873). For now,
      don't use both.

- name: Compatibility check - Fail if trying to install Docker SDK or Docker Stack in Amazon Linux
  when:
    - _docker_os_dist == "Amazon"
    - (docker_sdk | bool) or (docker_stack | bool)
  ansible.builtin.fail:
    msg: >
      Setting `docker_sdk` or `docker_stack` to true is not supported
      by this role for Amazon Linux due to library dependency issues.
